            <h1> Q: Nova Pulse </h1>
            <p>
                Astra stuns all agents inside it's radius after a brief delay by using a star. It's a great ability to use on 
                attack and defense, whether or not it will come into play depends on how well you know the map and the enemy team.
                And  Using it early on in a round can surprise players and give your team a chance to push onto site effectively.

            <h1> E: Nebula (max: 2) </h1>
            <p> 
                By consuming a star, you will be able to smoke off a location similarity to other controllers. You are able to store up to 
                2 charges but is also able to recharge your E ability after a 25 second cooldown(unlike other agents). You get back both 
                charges after this cooldown.
            </p>

            <h1> C: Gravity Well </h1>
            <p> 
                This ability creates a blackhole-like effect that pulls all players toward its center. After a delay, it will burst, 
                granting the vulnerable debuff(receive double damage) to any agents inside it. Gravity Well will be useful for 
                disrupting enemy movement and can be combined with nova pulse to get a easy kill. It's also recommended to use this
                ability with other agents that has molly to do extra damage afar. NOTE: Since gravity well pulls anyone into it's
                center, you can use this ability near the spike while the opponent is defusing. It will drag them away giving them
                less time to defuse.

            <h1> X: Cosmic Divide </h1>
            <p> 7 Points <br>
                Astra Ult: After pressing X, right click and hold where you want the wall to be. After a brief delay upon being
                cast, cosmic divide creates a huge wall across two locations. The wall blocks bullets and dampens sounds from the other side, but
                does allow abilities through. It'll will be very useful for situations like pushing onto a site on offense or 
                playing for retake on defense.
